Pujya Appaji used to visit Sri Sadguru Yallaling Appaji every morning, offer  His prostrations at the most sacred lotus feet of His beloved Guru and only  then commence the day’s work. Whenever Sri Sadguru Yallaling Appaji spoke to Sri  Sri Shadakshari Shivayogi Siddarameshwara Appaji, the latter would reverentially bend forward and listen. Whenever  They walked together, Sri Sri Shadakshari Shivayogi Siddarameshwar Appaji would never over-step his Guru. Whenever  both of Them were to occupy their seats, Sri Sri Shadakshari Shivayogi Siddarameshwar Appaji would wait for Sri  Sri Sadguru Yallaling Appaji  to be seated first. Sometimes when Sri Sri Shadakshari Shivayogi Siddarameshwar Appaji arrived a  little later than Sri Sri Sadguru Yallaling Appaji  to attend a function, He would pay his  respects to His Guru first and only then take his seat. Sri Sri Shadakshari Shivayogi Siddarameshwar Appaji would  listen to Sri Sri Sadguru Yallaling Appaji's discourses intently. </p>
